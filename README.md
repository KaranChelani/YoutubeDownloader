# YoutubeDownloader
Program that downloads audio and video files from youtube
# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
So far the main idea is to create a program that downloads audio files as well as video files off of youtube. Some other ideas we had we a rideshare app that works 
off of uber and lyft that allows people to pool eaiser and cheaper. Finally we had the idea of a real time currency converter.
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I'm going to be working with Sam Lovos and Andy Cherney


## Do you have any questions of your own?
The question that I have is if this program/app is legally allowed to do what it is intended to do as people can use it in order to get free downloaded music and
movies off of youtube. Additionally I wonder how difficult it will be to incorperate swift as I'm still catching up with learning python as I've had many personal 
roadblocks this semester.
