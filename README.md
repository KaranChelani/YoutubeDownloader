# YoutubeDownloader
Program that downloads audio and video files from youtube
# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
So far the main idea is to create a program that downloads audio files as well as video files off of youtube. Some other ideas we had we a rideshare app that works 
off of uber and lyft that allows people to pool eaiser and cheaper. Finally we had the idea of a real time currency converter.
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I'm going to be working with Sam Lovos and Andy Cherney


## Do you have any questions of your own?
The question that I have is if this program/app is legally allowed to do what it is intended to do as people can use it in order to get free downloaded music and
movies off of youtube. Additionally I wonder how difficult it will be to incorperate swift as I'm still catching up with learning python as I've had many personal 
roadblocks this semester.

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title will likely be "You-Down"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A program that lets you download content from youtube
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
This ios based applications purpose will be to download youtube videos as either audio files or video files. It was also store and organize these files making them
eaisly accessable to the user.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Andy Cherney tuk04822@temple.edu Joanne Nichols
Sam Lovos tui90088@temple.edu Tamara Kartic
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Making it be able to download youtube videos in mp4. format

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Having it be able to download youtube videos in MP3 and Mp4

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Leting the user be able to control the defintion of the videos downloaded to optamzed storage
Make the app allow the user to organize files into playlists ot categoreys.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Some new skills that we would have to aquire would be the use of the Swift programming language. Additonally we will need to research how to incorperate the library 
pytube3.
